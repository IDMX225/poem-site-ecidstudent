<p>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</p>
      <p>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</p>
<p>All mimsy were the borogoves,</p>
      <p>And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>

<p>“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!</p>
    <p>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</p>
<p>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun</p>
        <p>The frumious Bandersnatch!”</p>

<p>He took his vorpal sword in hand;</p>
      <p>Long time the manxome foe he sought—</p>
<p>So rested he by the Tumtum tree</p>
      <p>And stood awhile in thought.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
<p>And, as in uffish thought he stood,</p>
      <p>The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,</p>
<p>Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,</p>
      <p>And burbled as it came!</p>
    </section>
    <section>
<p>One, two! One, two! And through and through</p>
      <p>The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!</p>
<p>He left it dead, and with its head</p>
      <p>He went galumphing back.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
<p>“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?</p>
      <p>Come to my arms, my beamish boy!</p>
<p>O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”</p>
      <p>He chortled in his joy.</p>
